# Code-Quiz
Create a coding quiz to test users on their knowledge and create a leaderboard

# Description

This website hosts a very simple code quiz testing the user on three JavaScript questions. 

There is also a leader board page which hosts the initials and scores of quiz users.

# Usage

Press the start button to begin. Once the quiz begins, the timer will start to count down from 60.

Answer the question using one of the three multiple choice option buttons. If you are correct, you will move to the next question and the timer will turn green. If you are incorrect you will lose ten seconds and the timer will turn red.

Keep answering questions until you reach the end of the questions or the timer runs out.

When the quiz ends, your score is displayed and you can enter your initials to be put on the leader board. 

The leader board displays the name and score of all users with the option to clear the leader board.
